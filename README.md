Javascript  library for YouTube Feed API


This simple and small library will get a YouTube feed based on search, channel or playlists.

Simply create a youtube object and pass the arguments. Then make a call to the getVideos method with the callback function as an argument. 
```
 Usage:
 var myYouTube = new Youtube(query, query_type, duration, startindex, max_results);
 myYouTube.getVideos(callback); 
 ```
